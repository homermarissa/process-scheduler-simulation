# process-scheduler-simulation
Group members: Marissa Homer, Matthew Lewis, Shane Simpson

This is a process scheduler simulation program that I worked on in my Operating Systems class with Matthew Lewis and Shane Simpson. 

1. We have a set of processes with different attributes such as arrival time, burst time, process ID, remaining time, and priority

2. We used linked lists as our data structure to store our processes

3. We have both a fifo algorithm and a priority fifo algorithm used for scheduling; the user can choose which algorithm to use
   
4. We developed a simulation engine that manages the execution of processes based on a selected scheduling algorithm, as well as a timer to ‘interrupt’ the current simulated executing process
